1. Create a constant called myAge and set it to your age. Then, create a constant called isTeenager that uses Boolean logic to determine if the age denotes someone in the age range of 13 to 19.
*/
let myAge = 30
let isTeenager = myAge < 19 && myAge > 13

/*
 2. Create another constant called theirAge and set it to myage, which is 30. Then, create a constant called bothTeenagers that uses Boolean logic to determine if both you and I are teenagers.
 */
let theirAge = 30
let bothTeenagers = (myAge < 19 && myAge > 13) && (theirAge < 19 && theirAge > 13)

/*
 3. Create a constant called reader and set it to your name as a string. Create a constant called author and set it to my name, Matt Galloway. Create a constant called authorIsReader that uses string equality to determine if reader and author are equal.
 */
let reader  = "Hoff"
let author = "Matt Galloway"
let authorIsReader = reader == author

/*
 4. Create a constant called readerBeforeAuthor which uses string comparison to determine if reader comes before author.
 */
let readerBeforeAuthor = reader < author
