 ## Basic Control Flow
 ### Question 1
 Whatâ€™s wrong with the following code?
 
     let firstName = "Matt"
 
     if firstName == "Matt" {
         let lastName = "Galloway"
     } else if firstName == "Ray" {
         let lastName = "Wenderlich"
     }
     let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
*/
// `lastName` is not visible to the scope when setting `fullName`.
// A correct solution:
let firstName = "Matt"
var lastName = ""

if firstName == "Matt" {
  lastName = "Galloway"
} else if firstName == "Ray" {
  lastName = "Wenderlich"
}

let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName


/*:
 ### Question 2
 In each of the following statements, what is the value of the Boolean `answer` constant?
 */

let answer4 = true && true
// true

let answer5 = false || false
// false

 ### Question 3
 Suppose the squares on a chessboard are numbered left to right, top to bottom, with 0 being the top-left square and 63 being the bottom-right square. Rows are numbered top to bottom, 0 to 7. Columns are numbered left to right, 0 to 7. Given a current position on the chessboard, expressed as a row and column number, calculate the next position on the chessboard, again expressed as a row and column number. The ordering is determined by the numbering from 0 to 63. The position after 63 is again 0.

 ### Question 4
 Given the coefficients a, b and c, calculate the solutions to a quadratic equation with these coefficients. Take into account the different number of solutions (0, 1 or 2). If you need a math refresher, this Wikipedia article on the quadratic equation will help [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula).

/*:
 ### Question 5
Given a month (represented with a `String` in all lowercase) and the current year (represented with an `Int`), calculate the number of days in the month. Remember that because of leap years, "february" has 29 days when the year is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 100.  February also has 29 days when the year is a multiple of 400.

/*:
 ### Question 6
 Given a number, determine if this number is a power of 2. (Hint: you can use `log2(number)` to find the base 2 logarithm of `number`. `log2(number)` will return a whole number if `number` is a power of two. You can also solve the problem using a loop and no logarithm.)

 Given a number n, calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.  (Recall Fibonacci is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... Start with 1 and 1 and add these values together to get the next value.  The next value is the sum of the previous two.  So the next value in this case is 8+13 = 21.)
